UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISONResearch Participant Information and Consent FormTitle of the Study: Investigating how observers perceive, interpret, and evaluate visual features in 2D scenes and 3D environmentsPrincipal Investigator: Karen B. Schloss (phone: 608-316-4495) (email: kschloss@wisc.edu)DESCRIPTION OF THE RESEARCHYou are invited to participate in a research study about how visual and/or tactile (touch) features influence the ability to perceive, interpret, navigate, and remember information in visual and/or touch displays.You have been asked to participate because you saw a description of the study signed up to be a participant.The purpose of the research is to understand principles by people perceive, evaluate and interpret visual and/or touch information (e.g., the meaning of parts of a scientific diagram).This study will include adults from UW-Madison and nearby areas who volunteer to participate.The research will be conducted in the Schloss Visual Perception and Cognition, located in the Psychology Department and the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery, Living Environments Lab.WHAT WILL MY PARTICIPATION INVOLVE?If you decide to participate in this research you may be first asked to complete a standard visual acuity or color vision test.  If administered, the tests will examine your perceptual functions (e.g. color vision, and/or depth perception). You may participate in the tasks regardless of the outcome of these tests.You will then be asked to partake in a task from at least one of the following three categories: (1) computer/paper tasks, (2) touch tasks, (3) virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) tasks. In computer/paper based tasks you will be presented with visual displays containing images and/or text and will be asked to make judgments about them. For example, you may see shapes and be asked how round they appear or view a graph with a legend and interpret information about the data in the graph. You may also be asked questions about information on a particular topic related to the experiment (e.g., the visual or auditory system). You will be asked to respond by making button presses on a keyboard/mouse, marks on paper, or voiced sounds. The study team may record your voice. This recording will not contain identifiable information, and will be kept for future research. Sometimes you may hear sounds (beeps or music) played at a comfortable volume though headphones or speakers. For example, you may here a tone that signals the start of the next trial. You may be asked to complete questionnaires about your expertise or educational level in a given domain (e.g., neuroscience) and questionnaires about what sorts of things you like/dislike. Finally, you may be asked to respond to questions about your experience during the experiment (e.g., how much you enjoyed the task). In touch tasks, you will be asked to complete similar tasks as described for the computer/paper tasks, but rather than viewing visual displays, you will be asked to make judgments after touching textures with your hands. In VR/AR tasks you will be asked to explore virtual or augmented environments either in the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery (WID) Virtual Reality CAVE or wearing a head-mounted display (HMD), such as the Oculus Rift. The CAVE is a 6-sided 10’x10’x10’ room. You will be able to experience 3D models of virtual environments by wearing 3D glasses that are coordinated computer with projections of images on all sides of the CAVE. You will be asked to spend up to three 15 minute sessions in the virtual or augmented environment. While in the environment, you will be asked to explore the space and make judgments about what you see. You will be asked to respond by pressing buttons on a hand-held control.You will be asked to complete 2-6 surveys or tasks.Your participation will last approximately 30 minutes to 2 hours per session (as specified when you signed up to participate) and will require 1 session (30 to 120 min total).ARE THERE ANY RISKS TO ME?If you participate in a task that involves Virtual Reality or Augmented Reality (VR/AR) either in the CAVE or using head mounted displays (HMDs) there is a chance that you may experience mild symptoms similar to motion sickness including dizziness, headaches, eye strain, or nausea. Most often, these symptoms resolve quickly, but in some cases they may last several hours before completely subsiding. The CAVE is an enclosed environment and it is possible you might experience feelings associated with claustrophobia. The experimenter will be positioned right outside the testing area at all times and will assist you if necessary. You can take breaks if you need to and you can end the experiment at any time if you feel uncomfortable.ARE THERE ANY BENEFITS TO ME?There are no direct benefits for participating in this study.WILL I BE COMPENSATED FOR MY PARTICIPATION?Consistent with PSY 202/210/225 policies, you will receive 1.5 extra credit points/30 minutes of study participation.  At the end of the semester, those extra credit points are converted such that 1 point of extra credit = 0.33% added directly to your grade at the end of term.  Consult your class syllabus for additional details regarding the application of extra credit points to your final grade.   HOW WILL MY CONFIDENTIALITY BE PROTECTED?While there will probably be publications as a result of this study, your name will not be used. Typically, group characteristics will be published, but datasets with individual responses may also be shared. In such cases, the data will not be linked to your name or other identifiable information.WHOM SHOULD I CONTACT IF I HAVE QUESTIONS?You may ask any questions about the research at any time. If you have questions about the research after you leave today you should contact the Principal Investigator Karen B. Schloss at 608-316-4495.If you are not satisfied with response of research team, have more questions, or want to talk with someone about your rights as a research participant, you should contact the Education and Social/Behavioral Science IRB Office at 608-263-2320.Your participation is completely voluntary. If you decide not to participate or to withdraw from the study it will have no effect on your grade in this class.Your signature indicates that you have read this consent form, had an opportunity to ask any questions about your participation in this research and voluntarily consent to participate. You will receive a copy of this form for your records.Name of Participant (please print):___________________________________________________________________________________SignatureDate
